# colePicFrame2

Hi Professor, Unfortunately I have had a number of personal priorities as of late that I could not push off. I apologize for getting you an incomplete code as I did not make as many visits to my tutor as usual and relied on classmates and computer science friends as much as I could with previous knowledge to get this assignment done as best I could without just copying code.


Sarah Breslin and Paula were a big help when I got stuck as was Jake Filotto on helping me with the picture frame and panel but I was unsuccessful on getting the button assignments completed.  

I have class and another test today before 6pm so what I have is my finished product with deductions expected.

Thank you again for the knowledge you have given me about computer science even with it not being my major I can see it being useful in the aviation field.
